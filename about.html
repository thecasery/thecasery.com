          <h2>The casery</h2>
          <p> Here at The Casery, we are a group of creative, energetic people inspired by the dream of bringing you artistically driven cell phone cases.  Like our cases, everyone’s pretty unique here, and we have a lot of fun together.</p>
          <p> We’re each an artist in our own right, whether that art is filmmaking, photography, or graphic design.  That’s why the artists are our priority, and we aim to showcase their work in the best way possible.  We believe that everyone deserves a cell phone case that they enjoy looking at all day, every day (because, let’s face it, you look at your cell phone more often than your girlfriend).  And true art is the way to ensure that our cases offer more than just protection. </p>
          
          <hr>
          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>We live by the case, we die by the case. Inspiring creativity in a seriously fun way.</p>
          <h3>Our Dream</h3>
          <p>The Casery—powering the new wave of customization. </p>
          <h3>Core Values</h3>
          
          <hr>
          <h3>Embrace Your Inner Artist</h3>
          <p>Some of us draw. Some paint. Others design. And some can barely hold a pencil. We have a case for everyone. Whether you want to design it from the ground up, start with a base design and make it your own, or have a talented artists design it for you, The Casery has you (and your phone) covered.</p>
          <h3> Quality First</h3>
          <p>The Casery believes in high quality business. Our products are designed to reach for perfection, in both artistic design and top grade materials. </p>
          <h3>Support the World</h3>
          <p>Our company is about expression, and we think the best way to get the word out is through The Casery. From supporting local artists, to offering non-profit designs, The Casery will use expression as a force for good.</p>
          <h3> Individuality</h3>
          <p>We like people to be different. We encourage our employees to be just as unique as our cases. </p>
          <h3>Creation That’s Fun</h3>
          <p>The retail industry is changing rapidly, but people will always follow the fun. We see the fun as the most important part of our business, and we’d like to keep it that way.</p>
          <h3>Stay Connected</h3>
          <p>We’re the Case Crew for a reason. We’re friends. And we’re friends with our artists and community, too. Keep us posted, and tell us what you’d like to see next.</p>
